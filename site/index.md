# Kleroteria

## What would you write to ten thousand people?

Kleroteria is an email lottery.
Periodically, a subscriber - who may remain anonymous - is randomly chosen to write to all the other subscribers.

Their emails can be about anything.
On The Listserve, Kleroteria's spiritual predecessor, posts included personal stories, poems, and requests for advice.
One winner used their post to organize an impromptu picnic.
